# Transformers

I am currently writing code to implement transformer architecture from scratch using pytorch. This would be useful in making an LLM and getting a better understanding of how the LLM works under the hood.
In addition, some of the modules used in transformer model are useful for other projects, such as creating a stable diffusion model, which I plan to create from scratch as well
